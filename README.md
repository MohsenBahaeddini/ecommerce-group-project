# Wearables E-Commerce Project

You will make use of _everything_ that you have learned thus far in the bootcamp to build an e-commerce app that will showcase all of the provided _wearables_ items.

The stack is React.Js, Node.Js, and styled-components.

Your node server should be RESTful and follow REST principles, at least to the extent we learned during the bootcamp.

**âœ‹ You CANNOT use any external UI libraries, including, but not limited to, Material UI, Bootstrap to style your project!**

## Getting Started

<img src="./server/assets/software-dev-path.jpg" style="width: 100%;" />

You have your assignment and your team. What should you do first? This will vary for every team, and even every team member.

**The important thing is to NOT just jump in and start coding!**

There probably shouldn't be any coding until very near the end of the first day.

## Meet your Product Manager!

Each team has been assigned a product manager. This person is in charge of answering questions, guiding you and basically preventing everything from falling apart!

This person should be present for some of your team meetings, but not all. PMs are super busy people and have multiple projects/people to manage. ðŸ˜‰

## Planning

1. You will break into groups (with your assigned PM.)
2. Your PM will answer any initial questions, and give you more information, as required.
3. Breakout into a separate meeting with just your team. _Your PM will bounce from team to team to make sure you're on track._
4. Time to use the [Kickoff Meeting Agenda](__documentation/KICKOFF_MEETING_AGENDA.md)

### First team meeting

It could also be a good/fun idea to give yourselves an original team name. :)

Your first team meeting should start with the [Kickoff Meeting Agenda](__documentation/KICKOFF_MEETING_AGENDa.md).

## Teamwork

The most important aspect of this project is the ability to work in a team. No matter your contribution to the project, you should understand the **FULL** codebase. This will require that you

- **Review** each other's code.
- **Ask** questions when you don't understand.
- **Comment** your code extensively. _Always go for clarity over brevity._
- **Communicate** with your team.

## Updating GitHub

See the [Step by Step Document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Txc02kMSnTjyOWFj3HDXc5y5tSurt3AFJGpXZKxvX6A/edit?usp=sharing)

## Project Guidelines

You can see the guidelines [here](./__documentation/PROJECT.md)

## Presentation

Your team will have to present the final product on the final day in order to get a passing grade. Who will draw the short straw?

- The presentation shouldn't be more than 5 mintues long.
